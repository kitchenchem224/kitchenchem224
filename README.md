- Hi, I’m Nick (@kitchenchem224)
- I worked in medical devices for six years trying to solve a material problem. Many nights were spent in a hazmat suite.☣️
- then I realized I actually liked programming and tried to build something.
- but not knowing what I don't know was an issue.
- so I started reading comp sci books and making things.
- love dogs and nature.

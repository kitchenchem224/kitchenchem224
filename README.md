- Hi, I’m Nick (@kitchenchem224)
- I worked in medical devices for six straight years trying to solve a single materials problem. Many nights were spent in a hazmat suite.
- then realized I actually liked programming and tried to do something ambitious with it
- but the problem of not knowing what I don't know was an issue
- so I started plowing through the MIT opencourseware on comp sci, currently learning algorithms
